# 🧠 Challenge 3 – Inside the Mind of an AI Model

Welcome to my project submitted as part of the **Cloud & AI Builders Challenge – Educloud Academy**!  
This week, I explore the foundations of **AI models**, focusing on **neural networks**, **pre-training vs fine-tuning**, and the **training cycle of a LLM (Large Language Model)**.

## 🚀 Project Goals

This website, built with **PartyRock (AWS Bedrock)**, is designed to:
- Explain the basics of neural networks in a simple and engaging way
- Illustrate the differences between pre-training and fine-tuning with real-world examples
- Present a visual breakdown of the training lifecycle of a **LLM**

## 📚 What You'll Find

🔹 **Section 1 – Neural Networks**  
A clear description of how artificial neural networks work, including everyday analogies and examples.

🔹 **Section 2 – Pre-training vs Fine-tuning**  
A concise comparison of the two key training stages for models such as **GPT** and **LLaMA**.

🔹 **Section 3 – Training Cycle of a LLM**  
A diagram that maps out the process: data collection, preprocessing, training, evaluation, fine-tuning, and deployment.

🔹 **🎁 Creative Bonus**  
A meme/video/diagram shared on social media to make learning about AI fun and accessible!

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **PartyRock** (AWS Bedrock)
- **GitHub** for project hosting
- **Canva / Figma / PowerPoint** for visuals and diagrams

## 🧠 Personal Reflection

This challenge allowed me to better understand what drives generative AI internally. Designing visual content and simplifying technical concepts helped me grasp the logic behind **Transformers** and the importance of structured data.

## 📣 Social Media

The project is also published on my social media platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn) using the hashtag **#EducloudAcademy**.
